# Heart-Disease-Detection
Machine Learning project using classification algorithms testing the classification models K-nearest neighbours, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier to choose the best one for predicting Heart Disease with highest accuracy. Where Knn gives 86% accuracy on test data, Decision Tree gives 78% accuracy and Random Forest gives 90% accuracy.
